We are constantly updating the Forrun Device firmware, which is why it is important to update your Forrun Device regularly. You can update your Forrun Device via Forrun Mobile App or qForrun. There are three firmware update channels:

﻿DEVELOPMENT (Dev) - the current development ongoing build. This version of firmware is compiled for every new commit, sometimes several times per day. ﻿﻿Dev contains all the latest features, but be aware that it may be unstable, freeze, corrupt your data, or not work at all.

﻿RELEASE-CANDIDATE (RC) - the release version that is submitted for validation testing to the QA department. If bugs are found during the testing phase, the version is amended and a new RC is released. If the release candidate successfully passes all the tests, it becomes the release version.

﻿RELEASE - the final stable version of the firmware, which has gone through testing and is recommended for general use.
